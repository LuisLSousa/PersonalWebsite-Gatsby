Hey there! 

I am Luís Sousa, a Software Engineer from Portugal. \
I am currently looking for a job that allows me to increase my knowledge and contribute with a new perspective, taking ownership of my work and making a personal impact in the work environment. 
I consider myself a fast learner, and I am highly motivated to continue developing my skills. 

My master's degree in Computer Science at Instituto Superior Técnico, the top engineering university in Portugal, culminated in a dissertation focused on indirect reciprocity, a cooperation mechanism. My investigations about this subject made me keenly aware of the importance of working as a team member in a collaborative environment.

While writing my dissertation, I also began learning web development as an extra layer of skills on top of the ones I developed during my studies. This little side-project quickly grew until it became my main occupation and, shortly thereafter, my passion.

Regarding my interests, whenever the world is not affected by a global pandemic, I am an avid rock climber, and I like to travel abroad – exploring the unknown and experiencing different cultures.

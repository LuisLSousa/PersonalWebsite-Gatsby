## PersonalWebsite-Gatsby
This is the open source repository of my personal website, built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Feel free to edit the code to make your own version of the website.

## Build
Since this project was built with Gatsby, the first thing you'll need is the Gatsby client.
Make sure you have Node.js/npm installed in your computer, and run:

```console
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

Then, clone the repository and change into the working directory:

```console
git clone https://github.com/LuisLSousa/PersonalWebsite-Gatsby
cd PersonalWebsite-Gatsby
```

Install all the necessary dependencies:

```console
npm install
```

Start the development server with:

```console
gatsby develop
```

And, finally, if you want to build the application, use

```console
gatsby build
```
